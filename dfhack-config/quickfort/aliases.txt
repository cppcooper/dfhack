# quickfort aliases configuration file
#
# Defines custom keycode shortcuts for blueprints. Definitions in this file take
# precedence over any definitions in the baseline aliases configuration file at
# hack/data/quickfort/aliases-common.txt. See that file for aliases that are
# already defined.
#
# This file can be used to simplify repetitive tasks, such as building minecart
# tracks or adjusting a food stockpile to accept seeds only. Making new aliases
# is just a matter of mimicking the keys used to navigate through the menus and
# select options.
#
# Syntax:
#   aliasname: keystrokes
#
# Special keys:
#   {Right}, {Left}, {Up}, {Down}, >, < move the DF cursor
#   {/}, {*}, {+}, {-} can be used to navigate some DF menus
#   {Enter}, +{Enter}, {ExitMenu} - Enter, Shift+Enter, and Escape, respectively
#   {Wait} pauses playback briefly
#
# Special keys can be repeated by adding a number inside the curly braces, for
# example: {Down 5}
#
# Some shorthand:
#   &   expands to {Enter}
#   @   expands to +{Enter}
#   ^   expands to {ExitMenu}
#   %   expands to {Wait}
