This directory is for quickfort blueprints. You can apply them to your fortress
map with the DFHack quickfort plugin. See
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/Scripts.html#quickfort for details.

You can create blueprints by hand or by using any spreadsheet application,
saving them as .xlsx or .csv files. You can also build your plan "for real" in
Dwarf Fortress, and then export your map using the DFHack blueprint for later
replay in a different fort. See
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/Plugins.html#blueprint for more info.

DFHack blueprints follow the original Quickfort 2.0 syntax. See
https://github.com/joelpt/quickfort for joelpt's excellent documentation.

There are many ready-to-use examples of blueprints in the library subfolder.
